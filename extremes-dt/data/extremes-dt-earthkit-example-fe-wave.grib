The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is a mean over all frequencies and directions of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. <br/><br/>The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both. <a href='https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2016/16651-part-vii-ecmwf-wave-model.pdf'>See further documentation.</a> <br/><br/>This parameter can be used to assess sea state and swell. For example, engineers use such wave information when designing structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications."}, "unit": {"symbol": "s"}, "observedProperty": {"id": "mwp", "label": {"en": "Mean wave period"}}}}}
